## Project existed live on <https://multi-path-strings.herokuapp.com/>

## Data Structure

1. linked list, with four pointers.
2. story class contains the indexes of the 4 dierctions and the text content of the story.
3. store of stories, contains list of stories with the functions that required to work with.

## Notes

1. Typescript full stack.
2. frontEnd is in react.
3. server is in nodejs.
4. server and client are detached now, all the business logic is happening in react, cause I felt the project is simple and no need for server.
5. anyway, server is existed but detached.
6. main files: `./src/client/app.tsx` , `./src/server/controllers/stories/story.model.ts` and `./src/server/controllers/stories/multiString.model.ts`.

### IMPORTANT: I've spent few hours on this, needs few more hours to refactor the code, but I guess this fine. If you require any changes or additional work please let me know on `ahmad.ali.uk14@gmail.com`
